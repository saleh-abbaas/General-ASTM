This file contain random note I need to remember for software testing and validation

I can use following for testing tcp interface
	socat -x file:text tcp:127.0.0.1:11111
	socat -x - tcp:127.0.0.1:11111

-x help in hex outout, so nonprinting character are seen when they are returned by server

For testing tty interface following is useful
socat -d -d - pty,raw,echo=0
input_tty='/dev/pts/2'
(Read output of socat to find exact pty
